After months of both contemplation and procrastination, I've finally decided to start a blog!

I thought it would be difficult to decide on what platforms I should use to create, edit, and deploy my own blog. Little did I know that it'd be _even harder_ to come up with something interesting to write as my first post. Alas, this post is just a mental exercise for me as well as a way to test how my website looks when updating markdown files in real time (I'm using Hugo, and will probably continue to do so for the foreseeable future).

For all intents and purposes, this blog is to not just a way to discuss intriguing topics within the technical world, but also an avenue for me to improve my writing and communication skills. I feel that as software developers, we excel at talking to machines but often struggle to express our thoughts to actual **human beings**. I must personally confess that I am a victim of this, but actively making the effort to improve upon it when I have the time.

As I'm writing this now, I realize that I'll likely be the only person who will ever read this post for a long time, and that's okay. Whether this blog eventually reaches a thousand readers or just one (hopefully), I'll still be dedicated to providing quality content that I find interesting and easily digestible.

So, without further ado, let's begin this adventure and learn some cool stuff along the way!
